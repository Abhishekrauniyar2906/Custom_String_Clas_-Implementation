# Custom_String_Clas_-Implementation
Custom String Class Implementation in C++:

  Developed a custom MyString class as a part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project, demonstrating core concepts such as dynamic memory management, operator overloading, and 
  exception handling. Implemented key functionalities like string concatenation, substring search, and custom memory management, simulating the behavior of std::string.

Key Points to Highlight:

- Dynamic Memory Management: Emphasize how you managed memory allocation and deallocation.
- Operator Overloading: Mention how you implemented operators for a more intuitive string manipulation experience.
- Exception Handling: Note how you handled potential errors, such as out-of-bounds access.
- DSA Skills: Position the project as demonstrating your understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Design Patterns Utilized: Applied design patterns or best practices in object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation and abstraction, to enhance the design and maintainability of 
  the MyString class.
- Real-World Application Simulation: Simulated real-world string handling scenarios, providing a practical understanding of how string operations are performed in modern applications.
